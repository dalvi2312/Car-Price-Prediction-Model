# Car-Price-Prediction-Model
I have created a Car Price Prediction Model using Linear Regression, a supervised learning algorithm that establishes a relationship between car features (e.g., year, mileage, fuel type) and price. It fits a straight line to minimize the difference between actual and predicted prices, helping estimate car values for buyers and sellers.

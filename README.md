Car Price Prediction Model

Overview

I have developed a Car Price Prediction Model using Linear Regression to estimate the price of a car based on various features such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. This model helps buyers and sellers determine fair market prices.

Features

Predicts car prices based on input parameters.

Uses Linear Regression for accurate estimations.

Trained on historical car price data.

Helps in decision-making for car buyers and sellers.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas (Data handling)

NumPy (Numerical computations)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning model)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)

Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing car details such as:

Brand & Model

Manufacturing Year

Mileage

Fuel Type

Transmission

Selling Price

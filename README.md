Car Price Prediction Model

Overview:
I have developed a Car Price Prediction Model using Linear Regression to estimate the price of a car based on various features such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. This model helps buyers and sellers determine fair market prices.

Features:
1. Predicts car prices based on input parameters.
2. Uses Linear Regression for accurate estimations.
3. Trained on historical car price data.
4.Helps in decision-making for car buyers and sellers.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas (Data handling)
NumPy (Numerical computations)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning model)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)

Dataset:
The model is trained on a dataset containing car details such as:
Brand & Model
Manufacturing Year
Mileage
Fuel Type
Transmission
Selling Price
